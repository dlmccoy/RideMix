// application; the return value of handleOpenURL indicates whether or not the URL was handled by the
// session object, and does not reflect whether or not the login was successful; the session object's
// state, as well as its arguments passed to the state completion handler indicate whether the login
// was successful; note that if the session is nil or closed when handleOpenURL is called, the expression
